InsightMe is a personal data-driven journal.
Users can explore data via time-series with a seven-day moving aver-age trend-line.

A scatter plot with linear regression and Pearson correlation coefficient to visualize how variables relate to each other

Mood prediction: Each row represents the contribution of a feature
that was selected by L1 regularization. The row contains a red or green bar
if the contribution is negative or positive, and the size of the bar indicates
the magnitude of the contribution. The black box with whiskers is the mood
estimate with its 95% prediction interval.

Two methods explain how multiple linear regression computes the
contribution of a single feature on the final prediction. We call the method oin the left a
‘bar chart’ because it contains a chart with three bars and on the right ‘triangle chart’,
because it contains a red or green triangle inside a scatter plot
